The following results are produced via the test:

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.random_array()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 0.010685309011023492
Timing performed using: timeit.timeit()

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.loop()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 0.2247793039714452
Timing performed using: timeit.timeit()

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.snake_loop()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 2.3259056789975148
Timing performed using: timeit.timeit()


We can see that the implementation relatively same times as manual implementation with slower by one order of magnitude.
