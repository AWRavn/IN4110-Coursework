The following results are produced via the test:

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.random_array()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 0.0011531591415405273
Timing performed using: time.time() (manual timing)

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.loop()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 0.02205946445465088
Timing performed using: time.time() (manual timing)

Timing: test_slow_rectangle.snake_loop()
Average runtime running test_slow after 10 runs: 0.23078491687774658
Timing performed using: time.time() (manual timing)


Based on the average of 10 runs we can see that snake_loop() function is the slowest part of the code snippet is function snake_loop(), specifically line 83.
